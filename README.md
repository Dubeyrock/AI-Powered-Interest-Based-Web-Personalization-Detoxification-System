A Streamlit-based AI system that personalizes web content around user-defined interests (e.g., "Chess") while filtering toxic/distracting content. Built for SlateMate's FocusSphere initiative.


## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Interest-Based Filtering**: Prioritizes content using BERT embeddings
- 🛡️ **Toxicity Detection**: Blocks harmful content via Detoxify API
- 📊 **Well-being Scoring**: Combines relevance (70%) + safety (30%)
- 🎯 **Real-Time Feed**: Simulated YouTube/Instagram/Reddit content
- 📱 **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly interface for students

🖥️ Usage
In the browser:

Enter your interest (e.g., "Chess")

Click Generate Safe Feed

View recommendations + blocked content

Example Output:

✅ Top 10 Chess Openings (YouTube) | Score: 92.3
✅ Chess Puzzle of the Day (Reddit) | Score: 94.5
❌ Try Not to Laugh Challenge | Reason: Low relevance
